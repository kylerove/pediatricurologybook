## Not Just for Pediatric Urologists
Synopses are provided up front for pediatricians, patients, and families, so you have just what you need to know about your topic of interest.

## Code of Conduct
Many areas of pediatric urology suffer from a startling lack of diversity, with dramatically low representation by women, people of color, and other marginalized populations. And [it’s not just a pipeline issue](https://www.academicsurgicalcongress.org/aas-2017-president-address-caprice-greenberg-md-mph/). One way to begin addressing this problem is to be overt in our openness and to foster an atmosphere of purposeful inclusion and understanding. Please see our agreed to [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/) by all [editors]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/editors/) and [contributors]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contributors/) alike.
