# Conflict of Interest

## Principles

We the [editors]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/editors/) recognize the need for a conflict of interest (COI) policy to establish trust with a broad audience. This will help to foster proper balance, independence, objectivity and scientific rigor in the content of [Pediatric Urology Book]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}). Careful compliance and transparency by [editors]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/editors/) and [contributors]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contributors/) will inspire confidence, will avoid both actual bias and the appearance of bias, and will comply with legal and regulatory standards.
{: .lead}

We recognize that professionals—especially those involved in clinical care, leadership positions, policy-making, research, education, standard-setting, fundraising or outreach for a professional organization—are subject to COIs. Therefore, we consider it unwise to embrace a general policy which would prevent participation by individuals having relationships which may represent COIs. The existence of an actual or apparent COI does not imply fault or wrongdoing on the part of an individual.

Our policy requires disclosure of financial or intellectual relationships which may be regarded as possibly influencing the work of [editors]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/editors/) or [contributors]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contributors/). Relationships that may create a conflict of interest must be disclosed regardless of whether or not compensation was received. The potential for a conflict arises from the existence of the relationship not the monetary value. Relationships that may give rise to conflict of interest may be of a personal nature or through a familiy member. All relationships should be disclosed.

We require that all [editors]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/editors/) maintain annual updates to their COI disclosure using the appropriate [disclosure form]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/disclosure_form.xlsx), and all [contributors]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contributors/) must provide complete disclosure prior to publication or major revision (at discretion of the editors) of any content contribution to [Pediatric Urology Book]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}). All conflicts of interest will be published and updated below along with date of last update.

## Time Horizon

Any COI disclosure will cover the previous 12 months. COI updates will be requested with any major updates to a contribution by the authors.

## Types of COI

COI can fall into different categories. Sometimes, a specific relationship or disclosure may fall under more than one category. In these instances, the disclosure can be reported only once. Personal financial or intellectual relationships and those of immediate household family members should be disclosed.

## Enforcement
