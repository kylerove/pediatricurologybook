## Introduction

'Urinary stones' is a malady known to humans since early times; evident from the findings of urinary stones in Egyptian mummies. Sir G E Smith found a bladder calculus, dated to 4800 BC, in the mummy of the pelvis of a 16-years old in 1901 in El Amrah, Egypt. The calculus had concentric laminations of calcium oxalate, ammonium magnesium phosphate around a uric acid nucleus.{% cite ellis1979a shattock1905a schwartz2000a --file 09-49 %} Sushruta, India, 600 BC, in his medical text, Sushruta Samhita, described formation of bladder stones and perineal lithotomy! Urinary stone disease finds its mention in Ancient Greek texts and recognition by Hippocrates. Ancient Arabic medicine has perineal lithotomy described in a book by Al-Razi in 841--926 AD.{% cite l2010a --file 09-49 %}
{:.drop-caps}

Historical urinary stone disease literature is fascinating with the morbidity of the disease, the mortality of the surgical attempted cures, and the descriptions of "lithotmus, stein-schnieider, clysters, lithotryptors to crush stone!

## Incidence

The incidence in adults is understood to be at 10-12% lifetime risk. Though it was thought to be a male predominant disease, the gender bias seems to be equalizing. The cost of management of urinary stone disease is thought to be over 2 billion dollars in 2010 to over \$10 billion annually.{% cite bowen2018a --file 09-49 %} There has been over a doubling of incidence (from 7.9 to 18.5 per 100,000 children) in just over a decade in South Carolina..{% cite sas2010a ang2020a kusumi2015a --file 09-49 %} A Chinese meta-analysis has a similar observation.{% cite wang2017a --file 09-49 %}

## Factors Related to Formation of Stones in the Urinary Tract

Geographic distribution of stone disease has been well known. The 'stone belt' in the southern USA is an example. In the middle and far east, there is endemicity for bladder stones. In the UK, 'stone districts' such as Norfolk, were common during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, with subsequent decline in the endemic bladder stone incidence with improved nutrition. Colonel McCarrison noted the endemicity of bladder stones in India and its similarity in the UK.

Urinary stone disease may be related to many factors including diet, environment, geographical location, metabolic and genetic factors. The geographical variability is multifactorial with arid climates, water intake, salt intake, diet including protein load, fruits and vegetable intake.

Bladder calculi could be idiopathic/endemic, secondary and migrant. The incidence of bladder calculi is less in the developed world as compared to the developing world and may be attributed to a diet lacking in animal proteins. There is an overall decrease in the incidence of endemic stones 'the stone wave'. The incidence of bladder calculi in Pakistan has reduced from 70% in 1984 to 18% in 2007 and similarly from Satpura ranges in central India.{% cite soliman2017a --file 09-49 %} Still, the Afro-Asian endemic bladder calculi belt continues to be a cause of morbidity from endemic urinary stone disease. An epidemiological study reveals the disease in Asia in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is similar to that in Europe in the nineteenth century.{% cite asper1984a --file 09-49 %} The endemic bladder calculi are commonly see in children between 1-5 years, with a peak at 3 years, likely due to weaning period and single cereal diet.{% cite soliman2017a --file 09-49 %} They are more common in males with M:F = 10:1, this may presumably be due to differences in urethral anatomy.{% cite philippou2012a --file 09-49 %}

It is unclear if augmentation cystoplasty stone disease incidence follows the geographic distribution of urolithiasis.

Stone formation is also related to UTIs and anatomic urological anomalies. One study found 18/54 children with calculi had associated genitourinary anomalies and another found calculi associated with genitourinary anomalies in 35.9% children.{% cite sinno1979a borgmann1982a --file 09-49 %} 80% of children with stones associated with infections are male. Infection related stones are found usually under 5 years of age.

Bacterial infections with proteus, pseudomonas, klebsiella and enterococci are strongly associated with stone formation, as the urease breaks down urea to form ammonium and bicarbonate, favorable for struvite stones. Matrix concretion, a soft radiolucent mucoid substance produced with infection may calcify ready and account for rapid formation of infection related stones. In one study, frequency of hypercalciuria and hyperuricosuria was higher in children with VUR.{% cite madani2012a --file 09-49 %} Eight to eighteen percent of children with VUR have stone disease and some may present later in adulthood.{% cite garc2003a roberts1989a --file 09-49 %}

Obesity and weight gain are independent factors in the development of urinary stones in adults and yet less evident in children. In one study, BMI of more than 30 had an odds ratio of 1.7 as compared to BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m.{% cite shattock1905a --file 09-49 %}{% cite kokorowski2012a --file 09-49 %} The disease may be changing from a disease of poorly nourished to be one associated with obesity.{% cite cambareri2015a --file 09-49 %}

## Bladder Augmentation

Bladder augmentation was first described in the canine model by Tizzoni and Foggi in 1888 and von Mikulicz described it in humans a year later.{% cite biers2012a --file 09-49 %} The number of botox injections to the bladder have progressively increased since 2006, going from a few hundred to over 4,000 in UK and it is not surprising that the number of bladder augmentations is reducing, as reported in the study by Biers _et al_.{% cite biers2012a --file 09-49 %} The reduction in the incidence of augmentation may also be related to availability of anticholinergics, CIC but also decreasing incidence of anomalies such as spina bifida. Though ileocystoplasty is the commonest augmentation, there are many other segments of the bowel from stomach to the sigmoid colon, including ileocecal segments that are used. Also, autoaugmentation and ureterocystoplasty are other modalities of augmenting the hostile bladder.{% cite cartwright1989a churchill1993a --file 09-49 %} Augmentation helped us move away from incontinent reservoirs to continent reservoirs. It has replaced urinary diversion as the preferred surgical method for neurogenic bladder or congenital bladder issues. The indications are incontinence or renal damage in presence of a small capacity high pressure bladder. This move towards augmentation was facilitated by works of Bramble and Adams in the late 80s.{% cite bramble1982a adams1988a --file 09-49 %} It was encouraged by the advent of CISC and 10-75% of patients require it to empty the bladder. Combination of anticholinergics and CISC increase the rate of continence with cystoplasty with low bladder filling pressures and preservation of renal function. Augmentation cystoplasty also remains an important tool in preserving the renal function post-transplant in patients with hostile bladders. There is no confirmation yet that the best graft survival remains in non-augmented bladders.{% cite basiri2002a rigamonti2005a --file 09-49 %}

Stone formation is common after bladder augmentation. It is reported from 3-40% but was reported in over 50% in the series by Palmer _et al_.{% cite lebowitz1987a hendren1990a blyth1992a defoor2004a edlund2001a kaefer1998a obermayr2011a hensle2004a palmer1993a --file 09-49 %}

The mean time for stone formation was found to be 30.3 months and most stone formation occurred within 3 years of the augmentation as reported by Zhang H _et al_.{% cite zhang2005a --file 09-49 %} The stone formation is reported from 25 months to 39 months.{% cite blyth1992a mathoera2000a --file 09-49 %} In another report, the median time for stone formation in adults with a history of augmentation cystoplasty was reported to be 16 years, a range of 5--38 years.{% cite husmann2018a --file 09-49 %}

## Stone Composition in Children

- Calcium oxalate: 45--65 %
- Calcium phosphate: 14--30%
- Struvite: 13%
- Cystine: 5%
- Uric acid: 4%
- Miscellaneous: 4%

The metabolic derangements that lead to increased incidence of stone formation in children without augmentation are hypophosphaturia, hypomagnesuria, hypocitraturia, hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria, xanthinuria, cystinuria.

In patients with augmented bladders, infectious stones are most likely to be struvite, followed by carbonate apatite, ammonium acid ureate or mixed, while non-infectious stones are most likely to be calcium phosphate followed by calcium oxalate and uric acid.{% cite szymanski2016a --file 09-49 %}

Stones are less common in Augmentation cystoplasties who can void spontaneously and efficiently and occur in less than 2% of patients. The incidence is 5 times more if CISC is used per urethra but rises to 10 times if using a Mitrofanoff channel. This finding implies a role of stasis.{% cite nurse1996a --file 09-49 %}

The addition of bladder neck procedure, catheterizable channel or both with augmentation significantly increased the risk of stone formation as compared to augmentation alone..{% cite kronner1998a --file 09-49 %} A stoma created at time of AC was associated with an increased hazard of bladder stones. The 10 year cumulative risk of developing lower tract stones was expected to be 13--36%.{% cite schlomer2014a --file 09-49 %}

Hensle _et al_ reported over 10 percent incidence in their study and were concerned that sedentary habitus in spina bifida patients would lead to more stones.{% cite hensle2004a --file 09-49 %} They subsequently in other study showed that the patients with immobility and sensory impairment were worse off and similar to Nurse _et al_ finding reservoir calculi in 66% as compared to 15% those who used native urethra.{% cite hensle2004a nurse1996a --file 09-49 %} Bladder stones occur about 10 times more often in SB patients than in the population and approximately 1% of patients with spina bifida develop stones annually after augmentation.{% cite salama2021a --file 09-49 %} The predicted 'lifetime incidence' was 2.25 episodes per 1,000 patient-years. 14/260 patients (5.4%) spina bifida patients were found to have bladder stones in a retrospective study by Veenboer _et al_.{% cite veenboer2013a --file 09-49 %}

Stones are commonly triple phosphate implying that bacteriuria with urease producing bacteria (proteus, klebsiella) may be the cause as found in many reports. In one study, patients with augmented bladders were typically linked to metabolic abnormalities and were non-infectious.{% cite szymanski2016a --file 09-49 %}

Uric acid stone formation has been reported in bladder augmentation using stomach.{% cite garzotto1995a --file 09-49 %}

Cloacal exstrophy patients may be prone to metabolic abnormalities that increases the stone risk and affect composition of stones. Szymanski _et al_ found cloacal exstrophy patients to have uric acid stones significantly more than other types.{% cite szymanski2016a --file 09-49 %}

Metabolic factors in patients with augmentation cystoplasty that have been associated with stone formation like hypocitraturia and high calcium phosphate ratio in bladder mucus may also predispose to stone formation.{% cite khoury1997a --file 09-49 %}

Up to 60% of bladder stones in post enteric bladder augmentation are due to metabolic factors. The loss of bowel length and ileal volume, malabsorption of bile salts leading to steatorrhea, relative dehydration due to diarrhea, loss of enteric bicarbonate, and eventual metabolic acidosis resulting into hyperoxaluria, hyperuricosuria and hypocitraturia. Mobilization of the calcium phosphate from the bony stores due to immobilization or to buffer the metabolic acidosis may also lead to hypercalciuria.{% cite husmann2018a hamid2008a --file 09-49 %}

Metallic staples used in the operation are known to be associated with stone formation.{% cite dangman1991a --file 09-49 %} Even absorbable staples used for approximating reconfigured bowel segments have been found to be associated with the stone formation with a ghost of the staple found in the calculus mass![]

Stones seen in exstrophy bladder augmentation may be due to the keratine elements including at the time of repair.{% cite chatterjee2021a --file 09-49 %} Unintentional inclusion of the para-exstrophy skin, squamous metaplasia in the bladder mucosa de novo or down the suprapubic tract sites were found to be the site of stone formation.{% cite silver1997a --file 09-49 %}

Though the above multiple factors such as augmentation with bowel, presence of mucous, bacteria, nidus from non-absorbable material are all found to have a role in development of stones, it is still unclear which factor is most important.

Seromuscular bladder augmentation is an alternative to ileocystoplasty and may be associated with lesser stone formation due to lack of bladder mucous. Though Odeh _et al_ did not find any stone formation in SMBA in the 10 patients as compared to the other 30 who underwent standard ileocystoplasty it was not significant.{% cite odeh2017a --file 09-49 %}

In 1998 it was expected advances in tissue engineering and alternatives to methods of augmentation will relegate the stone formation to "arena of historical significance"![]

        -   Creatinine
            -   Dehydration due to vomiting and prerenal
            -   More severe elevation with solidary kidney, bilateral obstruction, advanced chronic kidney disease
        -   Calcium, phosphorous, bicarbonate, magnesium, and uric acid levels are effective in screening

            -   Ratio of calcium, uric acid, citrate and oxalate levels to creatinine level in random urine sample
    -   Microscopic urinalysis for crystalluria - not diagnostic unless hexagonal crystals (cystine) or coffin lid--shaped triple phosphate crystals (struvite) are seen
    -   Stone analysis
        -   Stone composition can change over time, therefore recurrent stones should be analyzed as well

        -   Identifying urinary tract abnormalities
        -   Detecting complications
    -   Plain abdominal x-ray{% cite mandeville2011a --file 09-49 %}
        -   Sensitivity in detection of renal calculi 45--58%, can pick up 50% of bladder calculi
        -   While many stones are radio-opaque, calculi comprising of uric acid, cystine, xanthine
    -   Non contrast CT if US non-diagnostic despite clinical suspicion or when anatomical details needed to guide surgical planning

## Treatment Options and Their Outcomes

### Medical Treatment

Acute management

- Adequate pain relief---paracetamol, NSAIDs, opioids---equally effective, combination therapy being superior to single agents
- Parenteral hydration if not tolerating fluid
- Treat for UTI if suspected
- Strain urine for stone
- Medical dissolution therapy rarely used

### Prevention

Goals are to prevent formation of new stones and expansion of existing ones.

Recurrent stone disease in augmentation cystoplasty is an ongoing concern. Cohen _et al_ reported 63% recurrence after 5 year follow-up.{% cite cohen1996a --file 09-49 %} Thomas _et al_ found 38% recurrence in their review.{% cite thomas2018a --file 09-49 %}

Higher risk patients are those who are sedentary, wheelchair bound and with closed bladder necks. These patients require a more concentrated effort towards prevention with the use of irrigation and mucous clearance.

1. General
   -   Increasing urine volume---in all types of stones
       -   No matter the crystallized solute, role for decreasing solute concentration and therefore supersaturation, allowing for a lower concentration for nucleation and growth
       -   Especially important in warmer climates and during summer
   -   Decreasing salt consumption
       -   Excess salt intake is couples with increased excretion of urinary calcium
   -   In endemic bladder calculi, improving nutritional status, preventing diarrhea and fever, frequent voiding to avoid prolonged stasis of urine in the bladder
2. Specific
   -   Calcium stones
       -   Hypercalcinuria and hypocitraturia
           -   Urine ca can be reduced by decreasing dietary sodium
           -   Dietary ca should not be restricted---decreases intestinal oxalate absorption, necessary for growing bones
           -   Fruits and vegetables high in citrate can be an effective part of dietary regimen to prevent stones
           -   Potassium citrate---dual advantage of decreasing urinary calcium and increasing urine citrate
           -   When diet not successful alone then thiazide diuretics---reduce urinary calcium excretion by increasing calcium absorption in proximal tubule
           -   Potassium sparing diuretics (amiloride)---enhance calcium reabsorption
       -   Hyperoxaluria
           -   Avoid high oxalate foods---spinach, rhubarb, nuts, chocolate, coffee, dark tea
           -   Pyridoxine (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>)---decreases urine oxalate
           -   Oxalobacter formigenes---oral intestinal colonization degrades intestinal oxalate, resulting in decreased blood and urine oxalate levels--- novel therapy{% cite alon2009a --file 09-49 %}
   -   Cystinuria
       -   Significantly increase fluid intake
       -   Maintain urine pH between 7--7.5---cystine solubility increases dramatically in alkaline urine---with the use of potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate
       -   D-pencillamine and tipronin---sulfhydryl compounds, cleave cystine into two cysteine-disulfide moieties that are 50 times more soluble than cystine
           -   If D-penicillamine used long term then should be supplemented with pyridoxine (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>
    -   Captopril---also sulfhydryl agent, used with mixed results
    -   Infection related stones
        -   Formed in presence of bacteria which produce urease, causing breakdown of urea to ammonium and bicarbonate---results in alkaline urine which promotes formation of struvite and carbonate apatite stones
        -   Prevention includes
            -   Sterilization of urinary tract---only possible after infected stone has been removed
            -   Correction of underlying anatomic abnormalities
            -   Protection from infection
            -   Urine acidification
            -   Acetohydroxamic acid, a urease inhibitor, successful in adults, has not been used in children
    -   Uric acid stones
        -   Urine alkalization---potassium citrate - increases solubility of uric acid
        -   Dietary purine restriction
            -   Meat increases uric acid excretion but should not be limited in growing children unless excessive in patient with uric acid stones
        -   If needed, allopurinol can be added, as it reduces uric acid levels.{% cite scoffone2018a --file 09-49 %}

#### Bladder Irrigation

Bladder irrigation protocols with saline and gentamicin, reducing the mucus and bacteriuria are shown to be helpful in reducing the incidence of stones.{% cite hensle2004a --file 09-49 %} Use of hemiacidrin in bladder irrigation was thought to have an adjunctive role in decreasing particles after stone removal.{% cite blyth1992a --file 09-49 %}

- High volume (250 mL) daily washout with saline reduces recurrence of stone formation compared to 120 mL / 60 mL washout. Also reduces bacterial load and recurrent UTI.{% cite husmann2016a --file 09-49 %} With daily high volume irrigation the incidence is \< 5% over 10 years follow up.{% cite husmann2018a --file 09-49 %}
- Hensle _et al_ reduced the incidence of stone occurrence from 36 to 7% incidence with a bladder washout irrigation regime. They used 120--240 mL saline with a flush of Gentamicin once a week.{% cite hensle2004a --file 09-49 %}
- Kronner _et al_ also reported a 7% incidence of stone formation after the use of a washout regime.{% cite kronner1998a --file 09-49 %}
- Recurrent stone formers---use of mucolytic has been trialled, however has not been shown to benefit, although it is still advocated by some in the event of severe mucous production.{% cite husmann2018a --file 09-49 %}
- Washout with acetylcysteine solution (10 mL in 20% acetylcyteine solution with 40 mL saline) 2--4 times per day for severe mucous.{% cite heijkant2011a --file 09-49 %} They did a high frequency follow up to ensure compliance. 28 children included with formation of stones in 7%.

#### Type of Augment

- Seromuscular bladder augmentation recorded no calculi after an average 75 month follow up (range 36--120 months).{% cite odeh2017a --file 09-49 %}
- Stone development is rarely seen with gastrocystoplasties as it could be attributed to less mucus, acidic pH and less bacteriuria.{% cite kaefer1998a kronner1998a --file 09-49 %}
- It is advisable to not use non absorbable staples or wires in surgeries involving the urine reservoir-exstrophy bladder pubis closures or bowel for augmentation.
- New technology with autologous and tissue engineered augments are still in the experimental phase of development and may show some promise against the development of stones.{% cite unknown2017a --file 09-49 %}

### Diet

Fruits and vegetables containing magnesium, potassium, phytates and citrate may contribute to reducing the calcium load and thus calcium stone formation, but this action may be mitigated due to the oxalate content in some vegetables. Increasing fruit and vegetable intake in children with hypocitraturia is protective.{% cite meschi2004a --file 09-49 %}

Animal proteins, red meat and poultry, with sulphur containing amino acids (methionine, cystine, homocysteine and taurine) can result in net acidemia with resultant hypocitraturia and those rich in purines can lead to hyperuricosuria. Both hypocitraturia and hyperuricosuria can result in stone disease.{% cite curhan1993a --file 09-49 %}

The daily recommended sodium intake is recommended to be less than 1.5 g for children aged 1--3 years, less than 1.9 g for ages 4--8 years, less than 2.2 g for ages 9--13 years and less than 2.3 g for ages 14--18 years.

Low calcium intake does not correlate with low stone formation, rather high calcium intake may bind with enteral oxalate, reducing oxalate absorption and thus reducing urinary oxalate excretion.{% cite khan2016a --file 09-49 %}

The **d**ietary **a**pproach to **s**top **h**ypertension **(DASH)** encourages low fat dairy products, lean meats, fish and poultry, whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables. DASH helps in reducing red meat and fructose intake, adequate calcium intake and increasing the urinary citrate. It may risk increasing the oxalate intake. In one study, participants with highest DASH scores had a low relative risk of urinary stone disease.{% cite taylor2009a --file 09-49 %}

### Surgical Treatment

Traditional surgical management of bladder stones relate to the size and type of stones. Large stones either require open surgery or endoscopic or percutaneous litholapaxy. The added difficulty in the augmented bladder is risk of bladder rupture and access to the bladder. Often these children have conditions that made urethral access difficult, such as those with structural anomalies or surgically closed bladder necks.

Treatment is classified as below

- Endoscopic
    -   Electrohydraulic (less common due to mobility of stones)
    -   Ballistic / pneumatic
    -   Ultrasonic
    -   Combination
    -   Laser Holmium YAG
    -   Last Thulium
- Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL)
- Open

#### Endoscopic

Endoscopic technology in the late 1990s emerged to allow better access for the pediatric population. Endoscopic management including dilation of the urethra in selected older patients was performed, with electrohydraulic lithotripsy or simple extraction with forceps or basket retrieval.{% cite palmer1994a --file 09-49 %}

Access to the bladder can be achieved via the urethra, or if present, via the Mitrofanoff or Monti channel.

#### Percutaneous Access with Cystoscopic Guidance

Percutaneous access is also feasible, and seems to compare favorably when compared to the open group, without the complications of open surgery.{% cite docimo1998a --file 09-49 %} Percutaneous cystolitholapaxy has become the treatment of choice for children, due to difficulty with the size restrictions of the male urethra.{% cite salah2005a --file 09-49 %}

A guidewire is placed percutaneously with cystoscopic visualization, and the tract dilated to allow insertion of an access sheath such as the Amplatz sheath (Cook Medical, US) in various sizes. A nephroscope can then be used for direct stone retrieval or litholapaxy.{% cite ahmadnia2013a --file 09-49 %} Other instruments for percutaneous access are also possible such as a laparoscopic port.{% cite chatterjee2021a --file 09-49 %} In order to prevent trauma to the bladder with lithotripsy equipment a laparoscopic entrapment bag can be used to capture the stones before fragmentation and extraction.{% cite tan2014a --file 09-49 %}

Transvesical laparoendoscopic single site surgery has been described for primary bladder stones, however not in patients with augmented bladders.{% cite roslan2019a --file 09-49 %}

#### Mitrofanoff / Monti Channel Access

Complete stone retrieval is possible via the catheterizable channel. This requires serial dilation and the use of a sheath such as the Amplatz. This method has been shown to be safe without significant trauma to the catheterizable channel.{% cite thomas2018a --file 09-49 %}

More recently smaller scopes such as a 12 Fr mini PCNL kit have been reported with successful outcomes.{% cite sakly2021a --file 09-49 %}

Open surgery may still be required for large stones that are not amenable for minimally invasive access.{% cite nang2018a --file 09-49 %} This occurrence is less likely with current surveillance regimes and with prevention strategies outlined below.

#### Open Surgery

In a recent systematic review of \> 1,000 cases Davis _et al_ found that open surgery, transurethral and percutaneous cystolitholapaxy has comparable stone free rates, and ESWL was less effective.{% cite davis2021a --file 09-49 %}

### Suggested Follow-Up

- In the augmented patient, annual abdominal radiograph and ultrasound is suggested to surveillance.{% cite szymanski2014a --file 09-49 %}

## Conclusions

Bladder stones are a long-known issue that has troubled us for millennia. Most are associated with bacterial infection and 80% in male patients. Bladder augmentation using small or large bowel is associated with stone formation, from infection and mucous production. Urine composition can be altered either with diet, medication or flushing to help prevent the stones from forming. Surgical treatment is mainly endoscopic, with the ability to access the bladder percutaneously for excellent clearance without damage to the urethra.

## Key Points
{:.key-points-head}

1. Urinary stones occur in augmented bladder in up to 50%, with increased incidence if catheterizable channel is used within 3 years of augmentation, and sedentary patients.
2. Infection, metabolic factors, type of operation and staples play a role in stone formation. Stones are largely calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate or struvite if infection related.
3. Diet management, medical therapy and bladder washout may reduce the risk of stone formation
4. Continuous surveillance is necessary.
5. Multimodality treatment with use of endoscopic, laser, shockwave lithotripsy all has a role in individualized management of this children.
