## Urachal Anomalies

### Embryology and Anatomy

The urachus is a tubular structure that connects the allantois at the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder and is patent during gestation.{% cite jm2016a --file 03-18 %} The lumen normally closes around the twelfth week of gestation and obliterates completely. Following obliteration, all that typically remains is a fibrous cord running from the inferior aspect of the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder. The urachus is extraperitoneal and easily viewed during laparoscopic visualization of the pelvis ([Figure 1](#figure-1){:.figure-link}).

**Figure 1**{:#figure-1}{:.figure-number} Intraperitoneal laparoscopic view of the urachus. The fibrous cord of the urachus (median umbilical ligament) is shown in the midline extending down to the dome of the bladder. The rectum is inferior. The vas deferens can be seen extending laterally just above the rectum.

The urachus is covered by the folds of peritoneum to form the median umbilical ligament. Rarely, the urachus may have gaps in the fibrous cord or even complete obliteration of the cord. It is an important surgical landmark for marking the dome of the bladder to ensure proper placement of a vesicostomy.

### Classification of Urachal Anomalies

Urachal anomalies are due to failure of complete obliteration of the lumen during gestation.{% cite macneily1992a --file 03-18 %} Their anatomical classification is based on the degree to which the patency of the urachus has persisted and vary from complete patency and free flow of urine to a small blind-ending sinus tract from the skin ([Figure 2](#figure-2){:.figure-link}). A urachal cyst may be present at any location along the length of the urachus but are most commonly found near the bladder dome. A urachal diverticulum---the rarest anomaly reported---is a partial patency of the urachus draining into the dome of the bladder.

Interestingly there is a single case report of a patent urachus that spontaneously closed with 2 weeks of catheter drainage and persisted as a urachal diverticulum.{% cite cuda2005a --file 03-18 %}

### Clinical Presentation

**The most common presenting symptoms in children with urachal anomalies are umbilical drainage persisting weeks after delivery or a mass and/or pain due to infection.**{% cite naiditch2013a cilento1998a yiee2007a gleason2015a --file 03-18 %} The umbilical drainage may be clear, serous, purulent, or bloody and is a clue to its cause: persistent clear fluid leakage (likely urine) in an infant is suggestive of a patent urachus while cloudy, serous, or bloody fluid is indicative of an urachal sinus or cyst. There is a bimodal age distribution with presentation at a mean of 1-3 months of age for those with urachal sinus or patency versus 3 years for those who present with a urachal cyst.{% cite yiee2007a --file 03-18 %} **The differential diagnosis of umbilical drainage also includes omphalitis, omphalomesenteric duct remnant, or an umbilical granuloma**.{% cite cilento1998a --file 03-18 %}

Physical examination may also be helpful. A patent urachus or urachal sinus can appear as a dimple or indentation in the base of the umbilicus ([Figure 3](#figure-3){:.figure-link}).

Some urachal anomalies are incidentally discovered during the routine radiographic evaluation of other disorders, such as urinary tract infections or prenatal hydronephrosis. Urachal cysts are likely to be seen during ultrasound imaging of the bladder ([Figure 4](#figure-4){:.figure-link}).

### Urachal Carcinoma

As urachal carcinoma is not a disease reported to present in children or adolescents, the treatment of this disorder will not be included in this chapter.{% cite ashley2007a sheldon1984a --file 03-18 %} **As will be discussed in the section on management, the risk of an asymptomatic urachal anomaly developing carcinoma and, thus, the value of prophylactic excision are unknown**. **Risk factors for carcinoma in a urachal anomaly include size greater than 4 cm and age \> 55 years**. Calcifications are a common feature in carcinoma, however, the significance of calcifications in an asymptomatic benign urachal remnant is unknown.{% cite ashley2007a sheldon1984a --file 03-18 %} It would seem prudent to remove lesions with calcifications, given that calcifications that may be associated with chronic inflammation, which is associated with carcinogenesis.

### Radiologic Evaluation

Imaging is directed by the presenting symptoms and the degree of clinical suspicion.{% cite cilento1998a yiee2007a --file 03-18 %} A patent urachus that allows urine to drain freely through the umbilicus can be imaged with a high degree of sensitivity with either a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) or sinogram. Traditionally a VCUG was performed to identify the patent urachus and also provide an anatomical assessment of the bladder and evaluate for bladder outlet obstruction or vesicoureteral reflux ([Figure 5](#figure-5){:.figure-link}). However, **abdominal ultrasound is adequate for diagnosis in most patients, more widely available, less invasive, and less costly; thus, it has become the standard for diagnosis, and VCUG is reserved for complicated cases**.{% cite naiditch2013a little2005a --file 03-18 %} It is important to notify the ultrasonographer of the clinical suspicion for urachal anomaly so the midline abdominal wall is thoroughly examined. Infected urachal cysts appear as large heterogenous masses with complex fluid collections ([Figure 6](#figure-6){:.figure-link}).

The lesions may be several centimeters in diameter and can, on occasion, spread beyond the pre-peritoneal space and perforate the peritoneal cavity.{% cite lewis1996a ogebeven1996a --file 03-18 %}

**CT should not be considered an integral component of the routine workup** but can detect anomalies missed by US and thus is useful in cases of high clinical suspicion without clear diagnosis ([Figure 7](#figure-7){:.figure-link}).

**The evaluation should also include a renal ultrasound to ensure the absence of hydronephrosis or other congenital kidney anomalies**.{% cite cilento1998a yiee2007a copp2009a gonzales2001a --file 03-18 %}  The incidence of concomitant kidney abnormalities has varied widely in published series, but given the lack of morbidity and risk with ultrasound, it is prudent to include imaging the kidneys as part of the work-up.{% cite fox2011a --file 03-18 %} 

### Treatment

In general, symptomatic urachal remnants should be treated with surgical excision. This should include complete excision of the urachus from the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder ([Figure 8](#figure-8){:.figure-link}). 

![Figure 8]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/figures/figure-18-8.png){:.float-start .img-fluid}  
**Figure 8**{:#figure-8}{:.figure-number} Open excision of urachal cyst. A. Intra-operative view of a urachal cyst excision via an infra-umbilical midline incision. The cyst is in center with the bladder attachment to the right, and the fibrous cord extending to the umbilicus on the left. B. The specimen (cyst) after excision with the small cuff of bladder (right end of specimen).

The necessity of excising bladder mucosa with urachal cysts or sinuses that are not continuous with the bladder wall is debated.{% cite macneily1992a cilento1998a rich1983a mesrobian1997a mccollum2003a --file 03-18 %} Infected urachal cysts present another dilemma, as the marked enlargement of the cyst due to infection and surrounding inflammation make simple excision more difficult and may increase the risk of complications. One can approach the infected urachal cyst in either a single or staged approach.{% cite rich1983a mesrobian1997a minevich1997a --file 03-18 %} The relative merits and risks of the two approaches are further discussed below.

Surgical excision of the urachal remnant is curative and there are no functional sequelae from its excision, as it is a vestigial remnant. The main surgical dilemma occurs in patients who present with an asymptomatic lesion that is incidentally discovered in imaging.

#### Conservative Management

There are limited data regarding the long-term sequelae---namely recurrent infection and development of carcinoma---of urachal anomalies left in situ. Historically, excision was favored given presumed risk of malignant transformation, however, recent publications argue for a conservative approach.{% cite cuda2005a galati2008a --file 03-18 %} Closure of the patent urachus and regression of urachal cysts---even in the setting of infection---have been reported.{% cite stopak2015a nogueras-ocana2014a lipskar2010a --file 03-18 %} Recurrence of symptoms following percutaneous drainage of infected cysts appears to be rare.{% cite lipskar2010a --file 03-18 %} In one series, 92% of infants \< 6 months who were observed had resolution of infection, whereas 60% who underwent excision developed a post-operative infection indicating conservative management until at least 6 months of age may be prudent.{% cite stopak2015a --file 03-18 %}

For infected urachal cysts, urine culture and culture of wound drainage, if present, should be obtained. The most common organism cultured from infected urachal cysts is *Staphylococcus aureus* ([Table 3](#table-3){:.table-link}).{% cite ashley2007a stopak2015a mccollum2003a galati2008a --file 03-18 %} If the patient is stable, afebrile, non-toxic, without peritoneal signs, spreading cellulitis, or signs of fasciitis, initial management with antibiotics alone can be considered.

For unstable patients or those that fail conservative management, the infected cyst may be managed via initial complete surgical excision or percutaneous (US or CT guided) or open drainage. In the single-stage excision of the infected urachus, the margins of resection will be larger and result in larger soft tissue defect and the extent of the inflammation can extend intraperitoneal, which puts the abdominal viscera at risk. There is a small but significant risk of an enterocutaneous fistula and a higher rate of wound complications after primary excision of an infected urachal cyst compared to drainage.{% cite stopak2015a mccollum2003a minevich1997a yoo2006a --file 03-18 %} Percutaneous drains may incompletely drain multiloculated fluid collections. Traditionally, all cysts were excised following resolution of inflammation in a staged procedure. Several recent studies have demonstrated that recurrent infection is uncommon and, thus, delayed excision may not be required.

#### Laparoscopic Excision of the Urachus

In this era of minimally invasive surgery, multiple reports of laparoscopic, and more recently, robotic-assisted laparoscopic resection of urachal remnants in children have emerged.{% cite stone1995a cutting2005a yamzon2008a --file 03-18 %} Laparoscopic single site surgery has been reported as well.{% cite patrzyk2010a --file 03-18 %} The main advantage of robotic technique is the ease of suturing compared to pure laparoscopy.{% cite yamzon2008a --file 03-18 %} Visualization is excellent with a laparoscopic approach for the bladder but can be more challenging at the umbilicus if the ports are not carefully placed. The urachus should be resected from the base of the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder. Again, there is controversy as to whether or not complete resection requires excision of the dome of the bladder.{% cite stone1995a cutting2005a --file 03-18 %} 

Port placement is an important consideration.{% cite cutting2005a --file 03-18 %}  **Since the urachus originates at the umbilicus, this cannot be used as a port site**. The most common site for the camera is supra-umbilical (usually 1--2 cm). This gives enough working space to visualize the dissection from the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder. Working ports should be placed laterally on either side, usually at the level of the umbilicus. Alternatively, lateral working ports and camera placement (on either the right or left side of the abdomen) offers lateral visualization of the urachus and keeps all the ports infra-umbilical in location. The lateral port configuration will make suturing the bladder closure more difficult due to the angle. 

![Figure 9]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/figures/figure-18-9.png){:.float-start .img-fluid}  
**Figure 9**{:#figure-9}{:.figure-number} Diagram of possible port placement for urachal remnant excision. Unlike the set-up for most laparoscopic surgeries, the umbilicus cannot be used as a port site as it is the origin of the urachus and must be visualized in the dissection.

#### Open Excision of the Urachus

In infants and small children complete resection of the urachus can easily be accomplished through a small incision. It can be oriented in either a transverse or vertical midline. For infants, a small 1-1.5 cm incision midway between the pubis and umbilicus will give access to the urachus and allow complete resection from the umbilicus to the dome of the bladder with excellent exposure of bladder dome for closure. This small incision is comparable to the size of incision needed for the 12 mm camera port of the surgical robot and keeps the procedure entirely extra-peritoneal, eliminating potential intra-abdominal complications. In older or obese children or adolescents, it is prudent to make a vertical midline incision. If there is trouble with exposure, the incision can be extended up toward the umbilicus or down toward the bladder to facilitate complete removal of the urachus in these patients. Complication rates for simple excision are very low and the surgery can either be performed as an outpatient or with a short hospital stay if a catheter is left in place. Urine leaks or wound complications are more commonly associated with single-stage excision of infected cysts and not simple excision.{% cite mccollum2003a minevich1997a --file 03-18 %}

## Key Points
{:.key-points-head}

- Urachal anomalies most commonly present as umbilical drainage persisting weeks after delivery or umbilical mass and/or pain due to infection.
- The differential diagnosis of umbilical drainage includes urachal anomaly, omphalitis, omphalomesenteric duct remnant, or an umbilical granuloma.
- The absolute risk of an asymptomatic urachal anomaly developing carcinoma is unknown. Risk factors for carcinoma in a urachal anomaly include size greater than 4 cm and age \>55 years. 
- Abdominal ultrasound is adequate for diagnosis of urachal anomaly in most patients. Workup should include renal ultrasound to evaluate for congenital kidney anomalies.
- Symptomatic urachal remnants should be excised via open, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted approach. If using a laparoscopic or robotic approach, the umbilicus cannot be used as a port site.
- Uncomplicated infections of urachal cysts can be treated conservatively with antibiotics ± percutaneous drainage. Immediate excision carries significant risk of post-operative infection. Delayed excision is reasonable but may not be necessary as closure of remnants/cyst is possible and recurrent infection rare especially in children \<6 months old.

## Prostatic Utricle

### Embryology and Anatomy

In male fetuses, the production of Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) by Sertoli cells signals the rapid regression of the paramesonephric (Mullerian) ducts---which in females become the Fallopian tubes, oviduct, uterus, and upper 2/3 of the vagina---in the 8-10<sup>th</sup> weeks of gestation. The prostatic utricle is a small remnant of the paramesonephric ducts that persists in males as an expansion of the prostatic urethra.{% cite jm2016a --file 03-18 %} The utricle arises from the midline of the prostate at the cranial aspect of the verumontanum.

### Clinical Presentation

Prostatic utricles (PU) are not clinically significant unless complete regression was impaired and the utricle maintains a dilated, cystic appearance, acting as a diverticulum of the prostatic urethra. **Utricle enlargement is associated with hypospadias, cryptorchidism, disorders of sexual differentiation, and unilateral renal agenesis**.{% cite ikoma1985a hester2017a dai2021a devine1980a liu2019a farikullah2012a --file 03-18 %} Case series indicate PU dilation occurs in 10-33% of patients with proximal hypospadias, with incidence increasing with severity of hypospadias defect.{% cite hester2017a devine1980a --file 03-18 %} In one series of boys with normal external genitalia with symptomatic PU, unilateral renal agenesis was found in nearly one-third of cases.{% cite liu2019a --file 03-18 %}

PU may be asymptomatic, cause symptoms related to obstruction or urinary stasis---recurrent urinary tract infections, epidydimo-orchitis, urethral discharge, retention, stone formation, or post-void dribbling---**or may present with abdominal pain, hematuria, or hematospermia**.{% cite dai2021a liu2019a desautel1999a --file 03-18 %} Rarely, malignant transformation has been reported.{% cite liu2019a farikullah2012a nallabothula2017a --file 03-18 %}

**Dilation of the prostatic utricle may impede catheterization of males with hypospadias---**difficult catheterization may be the presenting or only symptom of prostatic utricle in these patients. Large utricles may be palpable inferior or posterior to the bladder on digital rectal exam.{% cite dai2021a liu2019a desautel1999a yeung2001a --file 03-18 %}

Differential diagnosis for prostatic utricles includes müllerian duct cyst (not continuous with prostatic urethra), bladder diverticulum, urachal cyst, and seminal vesicle cyst.{% cite liu2019a johnson2014a --file 03-18 %}

### Radiologic Evaluation

**Diagnosis is often established via retrograde urethrogram (RUG) or voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) as these modalities allow visualization of utricle orifice in relation to the urethra and bladder.** However, transabdominal ultrasonography is nearly as sensitive as RUG and may be adequate in detecting utricles that are large enough to warrant intervention.{% cite hester2017a kojima2001a --file 03-18 %} Utricles may be missed on imaging due to incomplete filling. Cross-sectional imaging may be performed and can aid in operative planning but is not necessary for diagnosis. Utricles may be classified on imaging as follows:{% cite ikoma1985a --file 03-18 %}

- Grade 0 -- confined to the verumontanum
- Grade 1 -- extends to or below the bladder neck (Image 1)
- Grade 2 -- extends proximal to the bladder neck (Image 2)
- Grade 3 -- opens distal to the external urethral sphincter

### Management

Successful conservative management of symptomatic utricles has not been well described and would generally require frequent or long-term prophylactic antibiosis for recurrent infection.{% cite liu2019a --file 03-18 %} **A variety of successful surgical approaches have been described with complete excision of the utricle offering definitive management.** For utricles with very small orifices, transrectal ultrasound guided aspiration and transurethral catheterization and aspiration, orifice incision, and fulguration have been all reported.{% cite dai2021a liu2019a desautel1999a babu2021a --file 03-18 %} These approaches are minimally invasive but confer higher incidence of symptom recurrence than excision. **Open, laparoscopic, and robotic-assisted approaches to excision have all been described, and there is no consensus regarding optimum approach.** The robotic approach may be advantageous due to the difficult location of the utricle. Utricles may be accessed via extraperitoneal, extravesical, transvesical, posterior sagittal, or perineal approaches.{% cite dai2021a liu2019a desautel1999a yeung2001a bayne2021a --file 03-18 %} Concomitant cystoscopy can help define the limits of dissection in laparoscopic procedures.{% cite yeung2001a bayne2021a --file 03-18 %} Reported conversions from laparoscopic to open approaches for utricle excision are uncommon.

The key principles of excision regardless of approach are adequate dissection, excision, and water-tight closure of the utricle orifice and avoidance of injury to the pelvic nerves, vas deferens, seminal vessels, seminal colliculi, and rectum.

## Key Points
{:.key-points-head}

- The prostatic utricle is a small remnant of the paramesonephric ducts that persists in males as an expansion of the prostatic urethra.
- Utricle enlargement is associated with hypospadias, cryptorchidism, disorders of sexual differentiation, and unilateral renal agenesis.
- Prostatic utricles may be asymptomatic, cause symptoms related to obstruction or urinary stasis, or may present with abdominal pain, hematuria, or hematospermia.
- Dilation of the prostatic utricle may impede catheterization of males with hypospadias.
- Symptomatic prostatic utricles may be excised by open, laparoscopic, or robotic-assisted approach.

## Bladder Diverticula

Bladder diverticula are rare in the pediatric population, occurring in 1.7% of patients.{% cite blane1994a --file 03-18 %} Diverticula may be either congenital or acquired; congenital bladder diverticula are much more common in the pediatric population.{% cite es2017a --file 03-18 %}

### Congenital Diverticula

Congenital diverticula are thought to be a result of a defect in the detrusor muscle. **Ninety percent develop around Waldeyer's sheath, which contains the ureter, and are known as Hutch diverticula**.{% cite psutka2013a --file 03-18 %} They may be classified as periureteral (diverticulum near but not involving ureteral orifice) or paraureteral (ureteral orifice involved in diverticulum).{% cite psutka2013a --file 03-18 %} **Distortion of the bladder wall and muscular tunnel of the ureter predispose children with these diverticula to vesicoureteral reflux**. Congenital diverticula not associated with the ureter develop in the posterolateral bladder.{% cite es2017a --file 03-18 %}

Congenital bladder diverticula are associated with genetic syndromes that impact connective tissue development: Ehlers-Danlos types IV, V, IX; Menkes syndrome; Williams-Beuren syndrome, and fetal alcohol syndrome.{% cite bayne2021a psutka2013a sammour2014a --file 03-18 %} **Unlike acquired diverticula, congenital diverticula are found in smooth walled bladders that typically demonstrate normal voiding mechanics, are solitary defects, and are not associated with increased risk of malignancy**.{% cite es2017a --file 03-18 %} Congenital diverticula occur more often in males and are generally larger than those acquired by neurogenic bladder dysfunction.{% cite es2017a --file 03-18 %}

**Figure 11**{:#figure-11}{:.figure-number} Intraoperative demonstration of large paraureteral bladder diverticulum with proximal dilation and medial displacement of ureter.{% cite bhat2012a --file 03-18 %}

### Acquired Diverticula

**Acquired or secondary diverticula develop because of neurogenic or obstructive pathology in the lower urinary tract**. Though the most common type of diverticulum in adults, secondary diverticula are rare in pediatric patients and signal severe lower tract dysfunction.{% cite es2017a --file 03-18 %} They are more likely to be found near the bladder dome, may be multiple, and are more likely to be seen in a trabeculated bladder. Acquired diverticula in general are associated with neurogenic bladder and bladder outlet obstruction, and in pediatric patients can be seen with posterior urethral valves & prune belly syndrome.{% cite blane1994a es2017a --file 03-18 %}

### Clinical Presentation

**Bladder diverticula in children most often present with UTI secondary to urinary stasis within the diverticulum or are discovered during work-up for hydronephrosis or febrile UTI and suspected vesicoureteral reflux**.{% cite psutka2013a bhat2012a --file 03-18 %} Upper urinary tract abnormalities can be found in 16-30% of cases.{% cite psutka2013a --file 03-18 %} Less common presenting symptoms include irritative voiding symptoms, hematuria, abdominal distention and pain, enuresis, bladder stones, and outlet obstruction due to distortion of the bladder neck.{% cite bhat2012a alexander2012a marte2015a --file 03-18 %} Rarely, bladder diverticula can present with complete ureteral obstruction or intra- or extraperitoneal perforation.{% cite sharma1997a livne1985a stein2005a britto2019a jorion1999a temiz2011a --file 03-18 %}

**Most patients with congenital bladder diverticula are asymptomatic, and---though far less commonly than acquired diverticula---may be incidentally diagnosed in adults.**

Given the association with various genetic conditions, the frequency of upper tract abnormalities, and the possibility of underlying neurogenic or obstructive disease, it has been proposed by some that all children with bladder diverticula be tested for chromosomal abnormalities.{% cite blane1994a --file 03-18 %} Routine genetic testing is not currently recommended for patients with single congenital bladder diverticulum.{% cite psutka2013a --file 03-18 %}

### Radiologic Evaluation

Bladder diverticula are often first detected on bladder ultrasound as a hypoechoic cyst off the posterolateral bladder wall. The differential diagnosis for suspected diverticulum on imaging includes urachal cyst, everting ureterocele, ectopic ureter, bladder herniation into inguinal hernia, and bladder duplication.{% cite psutka2013a --file 03-18 %} **Voiding cystourethrogram with lateral and oblique views is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of bladder diverticulum and allows simultaneous evaluation for VUR**.{% cite es2017a --file 03-18 %} Particularly in cases without VUR, intravenous pyelogram or CT or MR urogram may be used to clarify the anatomic relationship between the diverticulum and the ureter.{% cite psutka2013a --file 03-18 %} **The upper tracts of children with bladder diverticula should be evaluated for hydroureteronephrosis.**

**Urodynamic studies may be considered in patients with bladder diverticula if underlying lower tract dysfunction is suspected or if presence of a diverticulum does not adequately explain the patient's presenting symptoms.** Detrusor overactivity can be seen in around half of these patients, possibly secondary to hypotonia within and around the diverticulum and chronic urinary stasis.{% cite psutka2013a marte2015a --file 03-18 %} Diverticula complicate interpretation of cystometrogram, as they sink intravesical pressure. Stasis of urine within the diverticulum and associated VUR may also complicate results.{% cite psutka2013a --file 03-18 %}

**Endoscopic evaluation may help clarify anatomy and is recommended during surgical intervention but is not necessary for diagnosis of bladder diverticulum.**

### Indications for Repair

Though bladder diverticula do not resolve without intervention, not all patients require surgery. Adequate treatment of UTI and voiding dysfunction may resolve symptoms in patients with small, uncomplicated diverticula.{% cite psutka2013a --file 03-18 %} **For those with refractory symptoms or complicated diverticula, surgical excision is generally curative, and ureteral reimplantation can be performed simultaneously as necessary**. Generally accepted indications for surgery include the following:{% cite es2017a psutka2013a --file 03-18 %}

- Voiding symptoms refractory to medical management
- Diverticulum \> 3cm
- Frequent UTI
- Complicated VUR
- Urinary retention
- Upper tract obstruction or deterioration
- Bladder stones
- Rupture of diverticulum

Unlike in adults, malignant degeneration of the epithelium associated with pediatric bladder diverticula is generally not seen; however, any concern for malignancy would necessitate surgical intervention.{% cite es2017a --file 03-18 %}

**Prior to any operative intervention, voiding dysfunction should be evaluated and managed** to isolate symptoms related to diverticulum and their evolution post-operatively. **Associated pathology such as detrusor underactivity, bladder outlet obstruction, or spinal cord dysraphism should be addressed prior to diverticulectomy.**

Surgical intervention should be carefully considered in patients with underlying connective tissue disorders, as recurrence is likely in this population.{% cite psutka2013a jorion1999a --file 03-18 %}

### Operative Approaches

Bladder diverticulectomy may be performed endoscopically or via trans- or extravesical open or minimally invasive approaches. **Transvesical and extravesical approaches mirror those used for ureteral reimplantation, and reimplantation may be performed as part of the procedure** if necessary due to situation of the diverticulum or if indicated due to severe associated VUR. Cystoscopic evaluation of the diverticular opening relative to the ureteral orifice is recommended as part of operative planning. **Multiple case series have reported complete resolution of symptoms---or marked reduction in voiding dysfunction symptoms---as well as VUR following diverticular excision regardless of approach**.{% cite evangelidis2005a christman2012a --file 03-18 %} Occlusion of paraureteral diverticular opening via subureteral injection of bulking agents has been reported, though data on long-term efficacy are limited.{% cite cerwinka2008a aydogdu2010a --file 03-18 %} One comparison of endoscopic, intra-, and extravesical approaches demonstrated successful resolution of VUR in 79, 91, and 80% of cases respectively.{% cite aydogdu2010a --file 03-18 %}

Important surgical considerations regardless of approach are culture-guided peri-operative antimicrobial prophylaxis, avoidance of injury or devascularizaion of the ureter or vas deferens, avoidance of rectal injury in repair of large posterior diverticula, and post-operative bladder decompression.{% cite psutka2013a --file 03-18 %}

## Key Points
{:.key-points-head}

- Bladder diverticula in children may be congenital---due to defect in the detrusor muscle, most often around Waldeyer's sheath (Hutch diveritcula)---or acquired due to neurogenic or obstructive lower tract pathology.
- Distortion of the bladder wall and muscular tunnel of the ureter by Hutch diverticula predispose children to vesicoureteral reflux.
- Bladder diverticula in children most often present with UTI secondary to urinary stasis within the diverticulum or are discovered during work-up for hydronephrosis or febrile UTI and suspected vesicoureteral reflux. The majority of diverticula are asymptomatic.
- Voiding cystourethrogram with lateral and oblique views is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of bladder diverticulum and allows simultaneous evaluation for VUR.
- For those with refractory symptoms or complicated diverticula, surgical excision may be performed via transvesical or extravesical approach. Ureteral reimplantation can be performed simultaneously as necessary.
- Prior to any operative intervention, voiding dysfunction should be evaluated and managed.

## Summary

Urachal anomalies may present in various forms and most often cause drainage from the umbilicus or infection. Anomalies may be managed conservatively and can spontaneously resolve. Infected cysts may be percutaneously drained, and any symptomatic anomaly can be excised via open or laparoscopic approaches. The risk of malignant transformation of asymptomatic urachal anomalies in children is unknown.

Prostatic utricle dilation is associated with hypospadias and other genitourinary anomalies and may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms related to outlet obstruction and urinary stasis. Utricles may be diagnosed via RUG, VCUG, or US. For symptomatic patients, excision may be accomplished via endoscopic, open, or laparoscopic approaches, with endoscopic management conferring a higher risk of recurrence.

Pediatric bladder diverticula may be either congenital or acquired. Congenital diverticula are due to detrusor defects near the ureteral sheath and are associated with VUR as well as connective tissue disorders. Diverticula are often asymptomatic but may cause infection, irritative voiding symptoms, retention, or abdominal pain and are often associated with detrusor overactivity. Acquired diverticula are secondary to lower urinary tract obstruction or neurogenic bladder. Indications for operative repair include refractory or severe symptoms, size \>3cm, and associated urinary tract dysfunction. Intervention should be preceded by management of any other lower tract pathology. There is no consensus regarding operative approach, and ureteral reimplantation is often performed simultaneously.
