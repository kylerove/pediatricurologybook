## Introduction

Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters and sometimes kidneys. VUR is a risk factor for recurrent pyelonephritis, renal scarring, renal insufficiency and hypertension and is cited as a cause of end-stage renal disease in children.{% cite mathews2009a kaefer2000a smellie1994a garin2006a --file 03-16 %} Management of reflux is primarily aimed at reducing the development of these long-term adverse effects through prevention of pyelonephritis.
{:.drop-caps}

A paradigm shift in the evaluation and management of VUR has occurred over the last several decades, and clinicians should be aware of controversies in VUR management. It appears that active treatment of reflux has improved outcomes for some children such that the incidence of reflux-associated nephropathy continues to decline, but recent urologic literature suggests that the natural history of VUR does not follow a uniform pathway. Many children with reflux do not benefit from either diagnosis or treatment, as there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution without adverse effects.{% cite cooper2004a mattoo2011a --file 03-16 %} Clarification of which children do benefit from treatment is the greatest challenge to the advancement of vesicoureteral reflux management.

## Background, Incidence, and Pathophysiology

VUR occurs in approximately 1-3% of children, and 2.3% of new-onset ESRD patients aged 0-21 in the United States are reported to have a primary diagnosis attributed to reflux nephropathy. Incidence of ESRD with reflux nephropathy as a primary etiology has decreased steadily over the last twenty years.{% cite cornwell2020a --file 03-16 %} Previous international studies have estimated a higher prevalence of about 10%.{% cite cooper2004a zhang1995a --file 03-16 %}

Although anatomic references to the concept of reflux were made as early as the first century AD, pivotal studies in the 1950s first contributed to our understanding of the association of VUR, chronic pyelonephritis and renal scarring as we understand it today.{% cite hutch1952a hodson1959a --file 03-16 %}

VUR can be categorized as either primary or secondary. Primary VUR is attributed to an abnormally short intramural portion of ureter tunnelling through the detrusor muscle at the ureterovesical junction. In a normal junction, the intramural ureter is passively compressed during bladder filling, creating an antireflux mechanism. This mechanism is dependent on intramural length-to-diameter ratio and ureterovesical insertion angle.{% cite kalayeh2020a --file 03-16 %}

A short intravesical tunnel is associated with VUR, and the tunnel length is inversely proportional to the severity of the reflux.{% cite paquin1959a --file 03-16 %}

Secondary VUR develops when abnormal lower urinary tract function and elevated intravesical pressures overcome the antireflux mechanism and is associated with conditions like bladder outlet obstruction (e.g., posterior urethral valve) or neurogenic bladder. Secondary VUR may also be seen in children with no anatomic genitourinary or neurologic abnormality, but suffering from bladder and bowel dysfunction.{% cite koff1992a --file 03-16 %} The most frequent cause of secondary reflux is non-neurogenic bowel and bladder dysfunction, which is also one of the greatest risk factors for breakthrough UTIs.

## Inheritance 

A strong inheritance pattern exists with primary VUR, with up to 80% of identical and 35% of fraternal twins concordant for presence of VUR.{% cite kaefer2000a --file 03-16 %} Multiple polymorphisms associated with abnormalities in ureteral budding have been identified in patients with primary VUR, although no single gene has been found to predominate.{% cite eerde2012a --file 03-16 %} The probability of a non-twin sibling having reflux is about 25% and the chances of offspring having reflux are approximately 35-50%.{% cite noe1992a wan1996a --file 03-16 %} Interestingly, this relationship is not as strong in children with dysfunctional elimination which likely speaks to the secondary nature of VUR in this cohort.{% cite noe1988a --file 03-16 %}

## Vesicoureteral Reflux, Urinary Tract Infections, and Renal Scarring

The clinical significance of VUR lies largely in its association with congenital renal dysplasia as well as renal parenchymal damage occurring secondary to recurrent pyelonephritis. At least one-third of VUR patients have renal scars.{% cite weiss1992a smellie1991a --file 03-16 %} The presence of scarring implies regions of renal damage and increases the risk for long-term adverse sequelae.

### Congenital Reflux Nephropathy

In newborns with VUR, scars have been detected in association with high-grade reflux before the occurrence of clinical UTI.{% cite nguyen2000a --file 03-16 %} These "congenital scars" are thought to be regions of focal dysplasia or hypoplasia resulting from abnormal nephrogenesis as opposed to damaged normal tissue following pyelonephritis. Congenital renal dysplasia may be indistinguishable from acquired renal scars secondary to infection. Since DMSA scans are not routinely performed on neonates, it is unknown what proportion of renal scars attributed to infectious injury are actually due to abnormalities of embryogenesis.{% cite patterson2000a --file 03-16 %} While the ultimate etiology remains uncertain, they are regions of diminished renal function and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality independent of the development of infection-associated renal scarring.{% cite bailey1992a --file 03-16 %}

### Pyelonephritis and Renal Scarring

Urinary tract infections are common in children, affecting about 5% of girls and about half as many boys.{% cite elder1997a --file 03-16 %} An estimated 30-40% of children under the age of 5 who develop urinary tract infections have VUR upon further evaluation.{% cite hodson-a baker1966a --file 03-16 %} Renal scarring is believed to occur when infected urine comes in contact with renal parenchyma causing an inflammatory reaction; it has been associated with an increased risk of hypertension, proteinuria, and renal insufficiency.{% cite smellie1994a ransley1981a --file 03-16 %}

VUR as a factor predisposing to renal injury due to infection was first recognized in spinal cord injury patients. After surgical correction, these children had fewer episodes of pyelonephritis and urosepsis.{% cite winberg1994a --file 03-16 %} Further studies demonstrated a lower rate of new renal scars developing in children with primary reflux compared to those with secondary reflux from neurogenic bladder or voiding dysfunction.{% cite sukamoto1999a naseer1997a --file 03-16 %}

Permanent renal injury resulting from pyelonephritis can be identified as renal scarring on 99mTc dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scanning. In a meta-analysis examining the presence of renal damage in children hospitalized with urinary tract infection, approximately 34% of children with pyelonephritis had VUR, and of those with VUR and pyelonephritis, 72% had an abnormal DMSA scan.{% cite gordon2003a --file 03-16 %}

Renal scarring on nuclear scintigraphy may be detectable during or shortly after an acute episode of pyelonephritis. The sequelae from renal scars may not become apparent for many years; as long as 30-40 years have been reported between first renal-scarring pyelonephritis and the development of hypertension or end-stage renal disease.{% cite winberg1994a --file 03-16 %} The prolonged time between the apparent initial renal insult and the clinically apparent effects underscores the need for long-term follow-up of patients with VUR.

## Reflux Grading and Other Predictors of Outcomes

Because there is a high rate of spontaneous resolution of VUR in most children but potentially devastating clinical sequelae in others, identifying those most at risk is a primary aim of VUR management. The International Reflux Study classified VUR along a 5-point scale defined by the degree of retrograde urine flow and the accompanying distortion of the pyelocalyceal system ([Figure 1](#figure-1){:.figure-link}){% cite lebowitz1985a --file 03-16 %} Higher grades are associated with decreased spontaneous resolution rates and increased prevalence of renal scars.{% cite elder1997a schwab2002a --file 03-16 %}

**Figure 1**{:#figure-1}{:.figure-number} International Reflux Grading System.{% cite lebowitz1985a --file 03-16 %}

-   Grade I: reflux into the ureter only
-   Grade II: reflux into a non-dilated pyelocalyceal system
-   Grade III: dilatation of the collecting system ([Figure 2](#figure-2){:.figure-link})
-   Grade IV: more extensive dilation with blunting of the calyces and tortuosity of the ureter ([Figure 3](#figure-3){:.figure-link})
-   Grade V: massive dilation of the collecting system and severe tortuosity of the ureter ([Figure 4](#figure-4){:.figure-link})

**Figure 4**{:#figure-4}{:.figure-number} Grade V VUR

Multiple studies demonstrate a direct correlation between prevalence of renal scarring and grade of reflux..{% cite hoberman2003a --file 03-16 %} Renal scarring develops less often in non-dilating reflux.{% cite bailey1992a ylinen2003a rolleston1970a --file 03-16 %} The chance of developing further renal parenchymal loss has been shown to be higher in children with grades III-V reflux than in those with grades I-II.{% cite duckett1992a berg1992a --file 03-16 %} Renal scars have also been demonstrated to be a negative predictor of VUR resolution independent of reflux grade.{% cite nepple2008a --file 03-16 %} Unfortunately, the international reflux grading system is subjective with poor inter-rater reliability.{% cite metcalfe2012a greenfield2012a --file 03-16 %}

More recently, additional factors influencing reflux resolution and breakthrough UTIs have been identified. Clinical factors predictive of reflux resolution, risk of renal injury and/or breakthrough UTIs include age, gender (female gender increases risk), circumcision status (circumcision is protective for UTI), presence of bladder and bowel dysfunction, and prior history of UTI. Radiographic predictors include laterality (unilateral vs. bilateral), distal ureteral diameter ratio (relative to the L1-L3 intervertebral body distance),{% cite cooper2015a arlen2017a cooper2013a arlen2017b troesch2021a --file 03-16 %} bladder volume at the onset of reflux (normalized as a percentage of age predicted bladder capacity),{% cite alexander2015a --file 03-16 %} bladder pressure at the onset of reflux, whether reflux occurs in the filling or voiding phase, and presence of renal scars.{% cite nepple2008a mcmillan2006a --file 03-16 %}

For neonates, a six-point vesicoureteral reflux index utilizing gender, VUR grade, anatomic ureteral abnormalities, and time of reflux during VCUG was shown to be predictive of VUR resolution, time to improvement, and breakthrough UTI.{% cite garcia-roig2017a arlen2020a --file 03-16 %} Similarly, a user-friendly neural network has been created utilizing demographic information, VUR grade, laterality, bladder volume at onset of VUR, UTI history, bladder or bowel dysfunction, and presence of breakthrough febrile UTIs to predict likelihood of VUR resolution, and is available at <http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu>.{% cite knudson2007a --file 03-16 %} Consideration of multiple risk factors improves prediction of clinical outcomes and permits more tailored individualized management of each patient.

### Bowel and Bladder Dysfunction

Children with bowel or bladder dysfunction have been consistently shown to have higher incidence of breakthrough UTIs, more renal scarring, a lower spontaneous resolution rate of VUR, and a higher failure rate following surgical treatment than children with "normal" elimination habits.{% cite mathews2009a keren2015a --file 03-16 %} These findings should be taken into consideration when determining management options for potty-trained children with VUR.

### Reflux Nephropathy/Renal Scarring

Children with renal scars are more likely to develop further UTIs and additional scars than children without renal scars.{% cite ylinen2003a lenaghan1976a olbing1992a --file 03-16 %} One retrospective study of 120 patients demonstrated a significantly higher chance of developing a breakthrough urinary tract infection in those with grades III-V reflux and an abnormality on baseline DMSA scan (60%) compared to those without an abnormality (6%), and another study showed a relative risk of breakthrough UTI of 5.1 in patients with renal scarring.{% cite mingin2004a loukogeorgakis2020a --file 03-16 %} In a study with mean follow-up of 12 years after an anti-reflux operation, children with unilateral renal scars had an 11% chance of developing hypertension and an 18.5% chance if they had bilateral renal scars.{% cite wallace1978a --file 03-16 %} Others have suggested the incidence of hypertension in children with bilateral renal scars is about 20%.{% cite edwards1977a --file 03-16 %} Children with severe bilateral renal scars are significantly more likely to develop proteinuria, chronic renal insufficiency and renal failure than those with unilateral scars or unscarred kidneys.{% cite jodal1999a mor2003a --file 03-16 %} These data strongly suggest that children with scarring are at increased risk for further development of additional scars and long-term clinical sequelae.

## Diagnosis and Evaluation

### Voiding Cystourethrography and Nuclear Cystogram

The only tests that routinely and reliably detect reflux are voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and nuclear cystography. A VCUG is performed by instilling contrast retrograde via a urethral catheter into the bladder and obtaining fluoroscopic images of the upper and lower urinary tracts during filling and voiding. A nuclear cystogram is performed using a radioisotope scanning technique. VCUG is an appropriate initial test as it provides better anatomic details, including the presence or absence of periureteral diverticula, ureteral duplication, and bladder or urethral abnormalities. It also allows for more precise grading of reflux. In addition, it permits measurement of the distal ureteral diameter which has been shown to be more objective and reliable than grade and of equal or greater predictive value in terms of resolution and clinical outcomes.{% cite cooper2015a arlen2017a cooper2013a arlen2017b troesch2021a --file 03-16 %}

Nuclear cystography is beneficial in that it reduces radiation dose compared to VCUG. Nuclear cystography reliably detects all grades of vesicoureteral reflux and may be more sensitive for the detection of intermittent VUR ([Figure 5](#figure-5){:.figure-link}){% cite lebowitz1992a dalirani2014a --file 03-16 %}

![Figure 5]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/figures/figure-16-5.png){:.float-start .img-fluid}  
**Figure 5**{:#figure-5}{:.figure-number} Left VUR on nuclear cystogram

If a VCUG demonstrates no significant anatomic abnormalities, nuclear cystography may be performed for follow-up studies in order to limit radiation exposure. Although the nuclear cystogram is frequently considered a more sensitive test, the ordering practitioner should be aware that each type of cystogram has limitations to its ability to detect reflux in a given population.{% cite mclaren2001a --file 03-16 %}

The American Academy of Pediatrics Sections on Urology and Radiology created a standard protocol for performance of VCUG in 2016 to maximize patient safety and ensure accurate results that directly affect patient management.{% cite frimberger2016a --file 03-16 %} Key recommendations included observing ALARA principles,{% cite strauss2006a --file 03-16 %} filling the bladder by gravity at 100 cm above the exam table, obtaining images of the urethra during the voiding phase, performing a cyclic study (multiple fill cycles), estimating maximum bladder capacity, recording bladder volume at which time VUR occurs, recording postvoid residual, recording bladder or urethra abnormalities (e.g., bladder diverticuli or posterior urethral valve), and grading reflux according to the International Reflux Study.

In addition to radiation exposure, catheterization can be a traumatic experience for a young child. Efforts to decrease the traumatic nature of VCUG include the use of lubricants containing local anesthetics, use of child life specialists, and conscious sedation. Historically, cystograms were repeated annually; however, with improved ability to predict timing of resolution it has been suggested that in children less likely to resolve VUR, the interval between cystograms should be lengthened to decrease exposure to radiation, the number of traumatic studies, and cost.{% cite knudson2007a knudson2007b arant2001a shiraishi2009a --file 03-16 %}

A relatively recently-adopted imaging modality in some centers is that of contrast-enhanced voiding urosonography (ceVUS), which has been shown in several studies to be safe and comparable to VCUG in detecting grade 2 or higher VUR, detecting intrarenal reflux and having good interobserver reliability ([Figure 6](#figure-6){:.figure-link}) It allows complete avoidance of ionizing radiation but does still necessitate catheterization and intravesical instillation of the contrast agent. Second-generation ultrasound contrast agents were not widely available until recently FDA-approved in the United States.{% cite kim2021a ntoulia2018a --file 03-16 %} VCUG does remain the gold standard for diagnosis of VUR until further research can show equivalent sensitivity and specificity of other testing methods.

### Nuclear Scintigraphy (DMSA, MAG3)

DMSA scintigraphy, in which the radioactive agent binds to the proximal tubules, has been found to be a more sensitive study than intravenous pyelogram (IVP) for the detection of reflux nephropathy.{% cite elison1992a --file 03-16 %} The scan provides information about differential renal function and can also detect changes of acute pyelonephritis with greater sensitivity and specificity than CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound.{% cite majd2001a --file 03-16 %}([Figure 7](#figure-7){:.figure-link})

![Figure 7]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/figures/figure-16-7.png){:.float-start .img-fluid}  
**Figure 7**{:#figure-7}{:.figure-number} DMSA scintigraphy following pyelonephritis showing photopenic defects in left kidney

The association of renal scars with higher grades of reflux and risk for subsequent scars as well as decreased resolution rates lead some to conclude that the standard initial evaluation of a child with a febrile UTI should begin with a renal scan and not a VCUG (the "top-down" approach). Using this approach, only in those children with an abnormal scan should a VCUG be obtained. The benefit of such an approach would be a reduction in the number of children undergoing VCUG and the identification of reflux in a higher risk group; in theory, patients with reflux but no structural or functional renal abnormalities might go undiagnosed, but the absence of such renal abnormalities suggests that the reflux is not likely to be clinically significant. Use of ultrasound as an alternative to renal scan has not been accepted because of decreased sensitivity. One study noted that up to 25% of patients with cortical defects on DMSA had a normal ultrasound, providing further data on the utility of renal scans in the evaluation of children with febrile UTIs.{% cite hamoui2008a --file 03-16 %}

Mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) scanning also has an improved ability to detect renal scarring compared to IVP. Although the DMSA scan is considered by many to be the most sensitive test for renal scar detection; the reported sensitivity rate of the MAG3 compared to the DMSA varies from 88% to equal to or slightly better than a DMSA scan.{% cite smokvina2005a sfakianakis2000a gordon1992a --file 03-16 %} Advantages of MAG3 include lower radiation exposure, cost, and time requirement, as well as visualization of the collecting system which may improve specificity compared to DMSA in those with significant dilation of the collecting system.{% cite smokvina2005a --file 03-16 %} Nuclear scintigraphy is usually deferred until 4-6 weeks of age to ensure adequate renal development for accurate results.

### Indications for Diagnostic Testing

The diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux is generally made after one or more UTIs or when suspected on the basis of abnormal renal imaging. Screening for VUR has traditionally been recommended in patients with prenatally-diagnosed urinary tract dilation (UTD) because reflux has been reported in up to 31% of infants with prenatal UTD; however prenatal UTD correlates poorly with severity of VUR.{% cite lee2006a herndon1999a nguyen2010a upadhyay2003a --file 03-16 %} The risk of VUR in patients with a non-dilated or a mildly dilated collecting system may be as high as 25%.{% cite herndon1999a berrocal2007a farhat2000a --file 03-16 %} Fortunately, VUR associated with prenatally detected UTD has a high incidence of spontaneous resolution.{% cite farhat2000a aubin2013a --file 03-16 %} Studies that assessed whether or not patients with both UTD and VUR are at increased risk for UTI (compared to UTD in the absence of VUR) show conflicting results.{% cite braga2015a zee2017a silay2017a braga2013a easterbrook2017a zareba2014a coelho2007a szymanski2012a --file 03-16 %} Judicious performance of VCUG should be considered based on risk factors for clinically significant VUR.

The utility of sibling screening for reflux is also controversial.{% cite noe1988a routh2010a --file 03-16 %} there is an increased risk of renal cortical abnormalities in screened siblings with history of UTI as well as ultimate diagnosis of high grade VUR.{% cite hunziker2014a --file 03-16 %} One study using insurance claims data did not find a significant difference in the rate of UTI between screened and unscreened siblings.{% cite nelson2016a --file 03-16 %}

It remains to be demonstrated whether detection and management of VUR in an asymptomatic screened sibling will result in significantly decreased adverse sequelae; therefore, no consensus regarding the practice of asymptomatic sibling screening for VUR currently exists. The AUA Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Primary Vesicoureteral Reflux in Children recommendation is that siblings be screened with a renal-bladder ultrasound (RBUS), with VCUG reserved for those in whom the RBUS is abnormal.{% cite skoog2010a --file 03-16 %}

Timing of evaluation for VUR in patients with history of febrile UTI also remains controversial. The AAP Subcommittee on Urinary Tract Infection published clinical guidelines in 2011 and reaffirmed in 2016 that recommended deferring antibiotic prophylaxis and VCUG after the first febrile UTI in the absence of an abnormal renal ultrasound in children aged 2-24 months.{% cite urinary2011a --file 03-16 %} The Randomized Intervention in Children with Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) trial studied 607 young children (2-72 months) with grades I-IV VUR after a first or second febrile or symptomatic UTI, and randomized them to placebo versus antibiotic prophylaxis. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis reduced the occurrence of UTI by 50%, but there was no significant difference in renal scarring between the groups, although the study was not powered to address renal scarring.{% cite mattoo2015a --file 03-16 %} A post hoc analysis of the RIVUR trial and another multicenter prospective trial (CUTIE) showed the incidence of renal scarring after one febrile UTI to be 2.8%, 25.7% after two febrile UTIs, and 28.6% after three or more febrile UTIs, reinforcing the utility of VUR screening after initial febrile UTI.{% cite shaikh2019a --file 03-16 %}

## Clinical Management

There is no universal optimal management for children with VUR. As previously noted, multiple anatomic and physiologic variables influence the likelihood of spontaneous VUR resolution and risk of febrile UTIs, while extrinsic factors such as patient and family preferences, medication compliance, social situations and risk of urinary tract infection rates must also be considered. Keeping in mind that the management of VUR should be individualized to each child after consideration of the multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors which influence outcome, we discuss the various treatment options below.

### Nonoperative Management

Daily administration of low-dose (\~ ¼ treatment dose) antibiotics is based on the knowledge that spontaneous resolution rates for primary VUR are very high (even for severe VUR in selected populations), and that postnatal reflux-associated renal scarring appears to occur exclusively in the setting of infected urine, particularly in the poles of the kidneys where the intrarenal collecting system is more likely to have compound calyces.{% cite coulthard2002a --file 03-16 %} Thus, maintenance of sterile urine until spontaneous reflux resolution may avoid the morbidity of surgery and renal scarring. A number of randomized studies have attempted to evaluate the efficacy and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with VUR.{% cite garin2006a montini2008a --file 03-16 %} These studies have generally failed to show a significant reduction in acute pyelonephritis or renal scars in children with VUR being treated with antibiotic prophylaxis. Some studies actually reported an increase in UTIs in children on antibiotics as well as an increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria causing the UTIs.{% cite garin2006a montini2008a pennesi2008a --file 03-16 %} By subset analysis, other studies identified younger age and increasing degrees of reflux as risk factors for recurrent febrile UTIs.{% cite montini2008a conway2007a --file 03-16 %} The multisite RIVUR trial demonstrated a reduction in UTI recurrence by 50% with antibiotic prophylaxis vs. placebo but no difference in the rate of renal scarring.{% cite investigators2014a --file 03-16 %}

Many question the need for antibiotic prophylaxis, suggesting that, in select individuals, the chance for pyelonephritis and renal damage off prophylactic antibiotics is small.{% cite cooper2000a thompson2001a jodal1992a bailey1992b --file 03-16 %} Between 30% and 50% of children with a history of one UTI will suffer from recurrent infections and because the diagnosis of reflux often follows a urinary tract infection, it leads many individuals to the erroneous assumption that the reflux is responsible for the infection. However, in general it does not significantly predispose to urinary tract infections unless it is of a higher grade.{% cite thompson2001a unknown1984a --file 03-16 %} More often, UTIs are due to predisposing conditions such as a previous history of urinary tract infections, female gender, constipation, infrequent voiding, incomplete bladder emptying, or impaired immunity. Multiple studies now demonstrate that children on antibiotic prophylaxis without breakthrough infections or evidence of renal injury can be safely observed without antibiotic prophylaxis or correction of VUR.{% cite cooper2000a thompson2001a --file 03-16 %} especially after bowel and bladder dysfunction has been optimized.{% cite leslie2010a --file 03-16 %}

In general, daily antibiotic prophylaxis appears to be safe and well tolerated, but it does incur cost and potential risks. It has been associated with a 24-fold increased risk of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistant *Escherichia coli*.{% cite allen1999a --file 03-16 %} Other studies have demonstrated the emergence of other bacteria with high rates of resistance in children receiving prophylactic antibiotics.{% cite cheng2008a --file 03-16 %} In addition to resistance, there are other concerns regarding potential side effects of long term antibiotics on the gut and urinary microbiome, as well as growth.{% cite cooper2017a guidos2018a gaither2019a akagawa2020a --file 03-16 %} Additionally, medication adherence should be considered. A 2010 study suggested that the compliance rate for merely filling the prescription was only 40%, suggesting that many patients placed on antibiotic prophylaxis never receive the medication.{% cite copp2010a --file 03-16 %}

Recognition and treatment of bladder dysfunction plays a large role in conservative management of VUR whether in isolation or with antibiotic prophylaxis. It is now recognized that secondary VUR is more appropriately managed by addressing the lower urinary tract dysfunction.{% cite fast2013a --file 03-16 %}

Several large prospective studies have attempted to address the efficacy of operative intervention versus antibiotic prophylaxis. These studies have generally shown no significant difference in renal function or growth, the progression or development of new scars, or UTIs.{% cite elder1997a duckett1992a unknown1984a smellie1992a j1987a --file 03-16 %} However, pyelonephritic symptoms, including febrile UTIs, tended to be more common in the medically treated groups.{% cite weiss1992a jodal1992a elo1983a --file 03-16 %} In general, children who ultimately underwent surgical intervention tended to develop renal scars at an earlier age, but no significant difference occurred overall with longer follow-up in terms of new renal scars in those treated with antibiotics compared to operatively.{% cite hodson-a belman1997a --file 03-16 %} These observations suggested that a potential benefit might be a reduction in pyelonephritis from the antireflux operations for some patients; however, other researchers suggested that, once renal scarring occurs, the disease tends to run its course and operative treatment has little benefit.{% cite winberg1994a ransley1979a --file 03-16 %} One review concluded that nine ureteral reimplantation surgeries would be required to prevent one febrile UTI, with no reduction in the number of children developing renal damage,{% cite hodson-a --file 03-16 %} again reinforcing the need to better define which children with VUR may benefit from intervention. Operative intervention is generally reserved for children with breakthrough UTI while on antibiotic prophylaxis, worsening renal function, or those in whom other considerations favor definitive intervention over daily antibiotic administration.

### Operative Management

####  Endoscopic Treatment

Since FDA approval of the use of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (Dx/HA) (Deflux®, Q-Med, Uppsala, Sweden) in 2001 for the treatment of primary VUR, providers have increasingly used endoscopic injection as an alternative to prolonged antibiotics.{% cite molitierno2008a --file 03-16 %} Dx/HA is the only FDA approved commercially available injectable treatment for reflux in the United States. It is a synthetic mixture of dextran microspheres in a hyaluronic acid gel that is injected using various templates in the region of the ureteral orifices.

Endoscopic correction of VUR offers a minimally invasive, outpatient procedure with low risk of complications. While it is a seemingly simple procedure, several studies have demonstrated a learning curve with improved results obtained with increasing experience.{% cite laeckgren2001a kirsch2003a dave2008a --file 03-16 %} Other factors associated with successful endoscopic correction include lower reflux grade, smaller UDR, absence of bowel and bladder dysfunction, increased volume of Dx/HA injected, visual assessment of mound configuration following injection, and surgical technique.{% cite dave2008a kirsch2004a mcmann2007a baydilli2021a --file 03-16 %} Studies of surgical technique have shown that the double hydrodistention implantation technique (HIT) enables higher success rates than other techniques including the STING technique, approaching that of ureteral reimplantation.{% cite kirsch2021a --file 03-16 %}

In the short term, VUR resolution rates for a single ureter treated with Dx/HA range from 59% to 95%.{% cite dave2008a routh2010b --file 03-16 %} If patients undergo a second injection for persistent VUR, the success rate is improved, but a third injection is rarely curative.{% cite molitierno2008a laeckgren2001a elder2006a --file 03-16 %} Long-term outcomes of patients with \>5 years of follow up show VUR resolution rates anywhere from 59-100%, affected significantly by degree of VUR, with rates of febrile UTI after injection ranging from 4-25%.{% cite kirsch2021a --file 03-16 %} Routine VCUG to confirm VUR resolution is controversial and not considered to be a requirement by some unless a patient is considered high risk for recurrence (high grade VUR, presence of febrile UTI after injection, age \< 2 years) or if it is family or surgeon preference.{% cite arlen2015a --file 03-16 %} Others advocate selectively obtaining VCUG only if a mound is not visualized on ultrasound. Ultrasound should be obtained post-operatively to rule out ureteral obstruction.{% cite wang2019a --file 03-16 %}

Aside from treatment failure, calcification of the implant secondary to a foreign body reaction has recently been reported as another potential long-term factor. Mound calcification is not unique to Dx/HA and has been described with many endoscopically injected agents.{% cite knudson2006a gargollo2009a --file 03-16 %} Calcification can be confused with ureterolithiasis, and providers must maintain a high level of suspicion for this entity to avoid unnecessary diagnostic tests and surgical interventions.{% cite noe2008a --file 03-16 %} Ureteral obstruction following Dx/HA is reported infrequently (\< 1%) and can occur shortly after surgery but has also been reported up to five years postoperatively, underscoring the importance of continued radiographic follow up of patients following Deflux. Obstruction can be asymptomatic, present with renal colic or urinary tract infection.{% cite vandersteen2006a papagiannopoulos2017a --file 03-16 %} Obstruction typically requires ureteral reimplantation with excision of the affected segment.{% cite papagiannopoulos2017a romain2016a christen2014a --file 03-16 %}

#### Ureteral Reimplantation

Surgical treatment of vesicoureteral reflux has evolved over the last five decades. A lower abdominal transverse incision for an open technique is typically used, leaving a small scar in the skin crease that is inconspicuous. Numerous operative techniques for ureteral reimplantation have been utilized; the primary differences include intravesical ([Figure 8](#figure-8){:.figure-link}) vs. extravesical approach. There is no clear documentation of any of particular technique being superior,{% cite elder1997a --file 03-16 %} and selection of a given technique is typically individualized to the child at the discretion of the operating physician.

Advancements in analgesia, surgical techniques, and the understanding that children undergoing ureteral reimplantation for primary VUR rarely need ureteral stents or prolonged bladder drainage has improved the length of stay and decreased the morbidity of the procedure.{% cite austin2004a --file 03-16 %} Several series report patients undergoing both intravesical and extravesical ureteral reimplantation surgery as outpatients.{% cite sprunger2001a marotte2001a palmer2009a --file 03-16 %} Results of multiple series document success rates with open ureteral reimplantation of greater than 95% and close to 100% for lower grades of reflux.{% cite barrieras2000a bisignani1997a el-ghoneimi1999a --file 03-16 %} The procedures do carry risks of anesthesia and potential complications including ureteral obstruction, persistent reflux, infection and bleeding.{% cite elder1997a --file 03-16 %} General tenets of ureteral reimplantation include minimizing ureteral handling, excision of the intravesical ureteral segment, development of a tunnel at least five times the diameter of the ureteral lumen, and creation of a tension-free anastomosis. In large ureters, tailoring through either excision or plication may be necessary to facilitate achievement of an adequate intravesical tunnel.

In recent years robotic-assisted laparoscopic extravesical ureteral reimplant has been increasingly used, with cited benefits of decreased pain and shorter postoperative stay.{% cite harel2015a --file 03-16 %} One multi-institutional study of 260 patients showed radiographic resolution of VUR in 88% of patients, a 9.6% overall complication rate and 4% rate of urinary retention following bilateral reimplant.{% cite boysen2017a --file 03-16 %} A nationwide data analysis showed increased rates of complications (13% vs. 4.5%) and increased costs compared to open procedures.{% cite kurtz2016a --file 03-16 %} Although use of robotic ureteral reimplantation continues as some centers, the use of open surgery remains the most prevalent.{% cite bowen2016a --file 03-16 %}

In patients in whom surgical intervention is considered, timing of elective surgery remains a matter of debate. Most studies evaluating spontaneous resolution rates for VUR have followed patients for 5 years. Although this endpoint is presumably based on the fact that the likelihood of *de novo* reflux nephropathy declines after age five,{% cite rolleston1974a --file 03-16 %} many clinicians and families infer that children who have failed to resolve their reflux by that time should undergo corrective surgery. However, in children without infections, timing of surgery can often be delayed; ureteral reimplantations in post-pubertal children and adults have been reported, with modifications in surgical technique owing to the differences in body habitus between adults and children, but with generally good outcomes.{% cite austin2008a --file 03-16 %}

### Individualized Management

While VUR itself can be simply defined, more detailed research confirms that reflux is not a single condition but rather occurs with wide variations in severity and impact. The answers to many questions regarding reflux remain unknown; however, it is clear that definitive treatment and even diagnosis of VUR is of questionable clinical benefit for many patients. Currently, decisions regarding treatment are based on physician and parent assessment of risks and benefits. Although the decision to pursue surgery has traditionally been based predominantly on the grade of reflux, a truly informed decision must consider multiple other variables, such as patient age, gender, history of UTI, renal functional status, likeliness and timing of spontaneous resolution, and risk of subsequent febrile UTI. Multiple prognostic factors relative to a child's chance for spontaneous reflux resolution have been defined.{% cite nepple2008a mcmillan2006a knudson2007a knudson2007b --file 03-16 %} A patient's social situation and parental preferences, as well as willingness to comply with either conservative management or postoperative care, must also be taken into consideration.

Attempting to determine the likelihood and timing of spontaneous VUR resolution in a particular child while taking into account multiple prognostic variables such as age, gender, grade of VUR, ureteral diameter ratio (UDR), bladder volume at onset of reflux, presence of dysfunctional voiding, history of UTIs, presence of renal scarring, laterality and duplication is extremely complex. To this end, a user-friendly neural network that incorporates many of these predictive factors is available for use at [http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu](http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu) ([Figure 9](#figure-9){:.figure-link}){% cite nepple2008b --file 03-16 %}

The use and accuracy of this model was validated on an international basis in a group of Japanese children.{% cite arant2001a --file 03-16 %} For children who have had a renal scan, a second computer model was generated incorporating the additional renal scan data to improve prognostic accuracy and is available at the same website ([http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu](http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu)).{% cite knudson2007a --file 03-16 %}

## Future Directions

Although improved accuracy regarding the likelihood and timing of spontaneous VUR resolution permits better management decisions, additional data is needed. Further studies are needed to define an individual child's risk of subsequent pyelonephritis, renal damage, and ultimately clinical sequelae. Continued data collection from large, multi-institutional prospective registries can allow for better understanding of the natural history of VUR. Additionally, biomarkers for detection of clinically meaningful vesicoureteral reflux may allow us to better determine those who most benefit from active treatment.

## Key Points
{:.key-points-head}

- Although the International Reflux Grading System is predictive for spontaneous resolution of VUR and for presence of renal scarring, it has poor interrater reliability. More objective radiographic measures in addition to grade such as distal ureteral diameter ratio and bladder volume at onset of VUR are predictive for spontaneous resolution and risk of breakthrough UTI.
- Multiple clinical and radiographic factors found to be predictive of clinical VUR outcomes are used in a variety of combinations in risk calculators and user-friendly neural networks such as [http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu](http://pedsurocomp.lab.uiowa.edu) to permit a more accurate individualized risk assessment in order to better manage patients.
- Children with renal scarring associated with VUR are more likely to develop hypertension, proteinuria and CKD and should undergo routine surveillance of blood pressure, renal function studies and urinalysis for proteinuria through adulthood.
- VCUG based on the presence of prenatal urinary tract dilation alone is often not clinically useful and a shared decision-making approach with the parents that incorporates the risk for UTI based on additional clinical and sonographic factors (i.e. severity of hydronephrosis, presence of hydroureter) is recommended to determine if a child should undergo VCUG
- Adequate control of bowel and bladder dysfunction plays a crucial role in the conservative management of vesicoureteral reflux with or without the use of antibiotic prophylaxis, and can in some cases obviate the need for surgical intervention.
- Aside from the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria, chronic antibiotic prophylaxis may have long-term side-effects including adverse impacts on the normal gut and urinary microbiome which may influence childhood growth and development.
