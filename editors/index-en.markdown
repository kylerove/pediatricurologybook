# Editors

Below you will find the editors responsible for the content of this book---including it's special digital features---made possible because this book was created for the internet and exists here alone.

The possibilities are endless with the use of online media like linking to contributors' social media accounts, embedding video and other media right in the book chapters, regular updates of content, and more. If you have any great ideas, please [contact us]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/contact-us/)!

# Liaison Editors

We cannot do this alone. Our liaison editor has helped us organize meetings, format content, coordinate social media campaigns, and has kept us on track to push out a new version of this book in record time!

# Emeritus Editors

We stand on the shoulders of giants.

The idea for this online book originated with the three editors pictured below. While all extremely-well published, they recognized that most authors' academic work is not directly compensated. And yet, there are entire industries whose sole product is this work---chapters, reviews, research studies, commentary, peer review, etc. The internet, however, offered a chance to invert this system and allow pediatric urologists to publish their expertise in an open manner free for all to read. Dr. Duncan Wilcox noted once, "[Pediatric Urology Book] is the academic work I'm most proud of."

In 2020, the three emeritus editors graciously offered to pass the torch, hoping to allow for new content and ideas to flourish.
